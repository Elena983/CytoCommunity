Unsupervised and supervised discovery of tissue cellular neighborhoods from cell phenotypes with CytoCommunity

How different cells in a tissue organize and coordinate with each other to support tissue functions in spatial proteomics approaches

2 modes

TCNs are identified per sample/image using the unsupervised mode and thus TCNs from different samples/images are NOT aligned.

Unbiased approach - infer TCNs for individual samples 

TCNs are identified per sample/image using the unsupervised mode and thus TCNs from different samples/images are NOT aligned.

2 CRC cores from COMET were chosen for further analysis
